 Python programming language definition from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
 
 Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
 Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
 
 Guido van Rossum (founder and creator of this language: Thank you) began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language,
 and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0, then Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, then Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision
 of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
